                        My Translator app was a final project for Certificate IV in Programming. The goal was the build of an app that used a REST API and .Net Maui. While the recommendation was a Weather App, I decided to challenge myself to do something different. I decided on a translator app as I love languages and the idea of building my own Translator appealed to me. The App had the functionality to translate langauge as well as save preferences and have them persist. These preferences included a light/dark theme, a saved list of favourite languages to translate to and a default set langauge to translate from. In addition these preferences could be overridden on the main screen language selects. The API was used to call a translation on button click and also to call, on start up, the list of possible languages to translate to or from, and save them to avoid subsiquent calls everytime the need to change a language occured.

                        This Project had the goal of creating a basic WPF UI that allowed a business to manage the addition and removal of Contractors as well as the addition and removal of Contracts. It had the added functionality of assigning contractors to certain jobs as well as reassigning them. There was also a filter to search the contracts or contractors by assigned or unassigned status and contract cost. For the purposes of this program all starting information was hardcoded and there is no linked data base running in the background. Any addition of Contracts or Contractors is lost upon closure of the program.

                        Wordle game was a basic build, in Python, with the purpose of teaching the principles of looping, file reading, object calling, and validating input against a variable. This simple program generates a random 5 letter mystery word from a pre-set list of words and asks you to guess the word. With each input it will validate your guess against another pre-set list of valid 5 letter words. If you guess is invalid (too long, too short, not a word) it will inform you why it is invalid and ask you to try again. Each valid guess is scored against the mystery word indicating if a letter is present in the word and in the same place, present in the word but in the wrong place, or simply not in the word. With each guess the loop counts down giving you a total of 6 attempts. Invalid attempts are not penalised.

                        This project was specifically created for teaching principles of O.O.P. for programming. With this program we have a Carpark with entry and exit sensors (potentially many exit and entry points) and display board(s) to display the information. This was used to teach the fundamentals of one to many, many to one and many to many relationships that can take place in programming. Int this example the program randomly generates licenceplates and stores them as cars in the carpark. The event of a car going in or out is randomly created with a limitor on a car leaving when there are no cars in the car park or entering if full. With each event the number of available bays is updated as well as a Temperature on a Display. It also has a timing function that creates the simulation of a closing time by which entry is prohibited and cars may only exit until the car park is clear. There is also a validator that checks the exiting licence plate against the list to ensure there have been no illegally entered cars.
